React Features and Setup

Features of React JS
1. It is component based()
2. It uses Virtual DOM
        a) DOM
        b) Shadow DOM
        c) Virtual DOM
3. It is faster.
4. It is modular
        - It uses only the library that is required for application.
        - It is not legacy.(these days all technology are modular) 
        - Application specific library
        - Application light weight(not load all library just use small interactive part only  that we need bcz of modular) -opposite of modular is legecy means complete library is used to handle small interction
        - It uses less memory
5. It uses built-in Async methods [Implicitly Asynchronous] means it has lot of things internally asynchronous , this improve the perfomance of application
asynchronous:- example of whatsapp and fb (loading- msg , image , video  light weight load first)

6. You can easily plugin any 3rd party


Issues with react(why dev are not satisfy all time by using react??)
1. React is not developed for what you are using.(lot of gaps but we are using them )ex- brand shoes not for casual , 

2. Lot of GAP's.(developers.facebook community   search in google) react n angular are not invention they are discovery by devloper this are already in market we just discover it 
[future trending language go google it is offiliate by google]

                           AS-IS                   TO-BE                    GAP
                         -------------------------------------------------------
                     what your                  what client               java 5%
                  technology is                      want                  .NET 10%
                   capable of                                               PHP 2%


3. Fill the GAP by using 3rd party library(dev take help library and plugging)
4. Lot of 3rd party libraries are required
5. Pace of development and poor documentation.(2014 to 2023 18 versions) any documentation is not complete for developer to take help
 

Q- can i built application by react and anguler combination == you can built bcz react can plug with  any framework


                            Setup Environment for React
                          --------------------------------

1. Download and Install "NodeJS" on your PC
               
                NodeJS version 18x
                NPM       version  8x

   -NPM is package manager.
   -Package Manager is a tool used for installing, updating and removing library.
            [ NPM, Yarn, Bower, NuGet ...]

            https://nodejs.org/en/

        C:\> npm   -v
        C:\> node  -v

2. Download and Install  "Visual Studio Code" editor

    https://code.visualstudio.com/


3. Open VS Code and Install extention
            "Live Server"



Using React in existing web application:

1. Create a new folder for  Web Application

                D:\web-app

2. Open folder in Visual Studio code

3.  Open Terminal

            > npm init  -y
            [ It generates package.json ]

4. Add folders
            - public            : It is for static resources , HTML, Images, documents
            - src                : It is for dynamic resources, css, scss, ts, js etc..

5. Add startup page

          src->  index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Index</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to React - 18</h1>
    <p>This page is not using react.</p>
    <p>React is in Home Page</p>
    <a href="public/home.html">Home</a>
</body>
</html>

       public-->home.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Home</title>
</head>
<body>
    <noscript>Please enable javascript on your browser.</noscript>
    <h1></h1>
</body>
</html>

- You can use react library from CDN (no need to download library u go to server copy the link and use that on file paste),
- react in HTML page requires 3 libraries
           
            a) react                 : It is the core library for React.
            b) react-dom            : It is the library to handle virtual DOM
            c) babel                : It is JavaScript compiler used by react.

  reactjs.org => docs => CDN Links => Development( copy react js link development link)

    </script>
